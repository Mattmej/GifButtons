Game Plan:

1. Create divs on webpage
    a. Section above the gifs for rating
    b. Section for the gifs

2. Make the buttons display gifs corresponding to the button labels
    a. e.g. If the button is labeled "cats," display cats.

3. Every time a button is pressed, clear out the old divs and add in the new ones corresponding to the pressed button

4. Create a way that allows the user to create their own buttons dynamically.
