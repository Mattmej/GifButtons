# GifButtons
By Matt Mejia

## This project is an example of an app that interfaces with an API via an AJAX request and performs various functions with the retrieved data.

_Specifically, this application performs an ajax request to retrieve data from the GIPHY API,  then uses this data to populate the webpage with gifs._ 

This application contains buttons that search for and display relevant gifs from GIPHY when clicked. Three buttons are initially displayed, but the user can create more buttons by typing topics in the search bar. New buttons will then be created based on these topics.
